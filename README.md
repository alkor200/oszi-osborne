# Oszi Osborne

This fun project uses pygame to control visuals on an oscilloscope with the input of a game controller. For this, sounds are generated on both stereo channels (left/right) of the sound card. 
By wiring the left side of the sound output to the X axis of the oscilloscope and the right side to the Y axis, different artistic visuals can be created.

Oszi Osborne is funny because of Oscilloscope in german is often called Oszi and Ozzy Osborne is a weird guy lol
